# Graph Algorithm Visualizer

This is a small project to visualize the basic algorithms for graphs

It is hosted on https://graph-visualizer-one.vercel.app/ and the backend is hosted on Render

PS : It takes some clicks for it to work the first time since I have hosted this on render with a free service which unfortunately isn't too fast.
